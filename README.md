# Odin-recipes

Recipes website to practice while following the path of The Odin Project.

Throughout this project I will learn the basics of HTML and CSS so this is not a production ready website or something to take in count if you are looking for talent.

## Reference

You can get the original recipes from [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com)
