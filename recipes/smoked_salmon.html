        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This smoked salmon dip combines cream cheese, fresh lemon juice and
            zest, dill, capers, and red onions with smoked salmon. Itâ€™s a fancy
            and yet simple dish to take to a party or serve at home as an
            appetizer. Make ahead if you like and serve cold with sliced
            baguette.
